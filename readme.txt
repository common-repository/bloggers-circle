== Description ==

Similar to a traditional writers circle, but with a work-flow optimized for bloggers.  This helps you get and give constructive criticism of your drafts, without annoying your friends.

Creative writing is surprisingly hard, and it takes time and patience to become a better writer.  By both receiving and giving criticism, we can use this tool to become better writers faster.

Bloggers can earn points by reviewing other bloggers drafts, and spend those points asking other bloggers to review theirs.

You pay more for top ranked reviewers, and less for lower ranked reviewers.  Reviewers that are ranked higher, earn more per review, so it pays to be nice.
